🎸 Guitar Store Demo

This is a demo project built while learning React with Vite and JavaScript (JSX). The application simulates a small online guitar shop, providing an interactive experience to practice state management, components, and user interactions.

💻 Live Demo: https://edmonguitarstore.netlify.app/

✨ Features

📦 Product listing – display guitars with name, image, price, and description.

🛒 Interactive shopping cart – users can add guitars, increase/decrease quantities (with minimum and maximum limits), and remove items.

💰 Automatic total calculation – updates dynamically based on user actions.

⚡ Persistent state with localStorage – cart contents are saved between sessions.

🧩 Component-based architecture – reusable components for guitars (Guitar.jsx) and the header/cart (Header.jsx).

✅ Hooks practice – uses useState and useEffect for state management and side effects.

🎯 Learning Goals

This project was my first hands-on React project, helping me:

Understand state management with useState.

Handle side effects and localStorage with useEffect.

Implement dynamic, interactive components like a shopping cart.

Organize a project using a component-based architecture.

📌 Status & Future Improvements

✅ Finished as a demo project for learning purposes.
⚡ Possible improvements:

Add routing with React Router for product detail pages.

Connect to a backend API to fetch product data dynamically.

Improve cart UX with notifications or animations.
