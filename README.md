# 🎸 Guitar Store Demo

This is a demo project built while learning React with Vite and JavaScript (JSX). The application simulates a small online guitar shop, providing an interactive experience to practice state management, components, and user interactions.

💻 Live Demo: [Guitar Store Demo](https://edmonguitarstore.netlify.app/)

## ✨ Features

📦 **Product listing** – display guitars with name, image, price, and description.

🛒 **Interactive shopping cart** – users can add guitars, increase/decrease quantities (with minimum and maximum limits), and remove items.

💰 **Automatic total calculation** – updates dynamically based on user actions.

⚡ **Persistent state with localStorage** – cart contents are saved between sessions.

🧩 **Component-based architecture** – reusable components for guitars (Guitar.jsx) and the header/cart (Header.jsx).

✅ **Hooks practice** – uses useState and useEffect for state management and side effects.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

React (JSX)

JavaScript (ES6+)

HTML & CSS

## 🎯 Learning Goals

This project was my first hands-on React project, helping me:

Understand state management with useState.

Handle side effects and localStorage with useEffect.

Implement dynamic, interactive components like a shopping cart.

Organize a project using a component-based architecture.

## 📌 Status & Future Improvements

✅ Finished as a demo project for learning purposes.
⚡ Possible improvements:

Add routing with React Router for product detail pages.

Connect to a backend API to fetch product data dynamically.

Improve cart UX with notifications or animations.
